Mechanics of Cardiac Flow

MONITORING BLOOD PRESSURE
Electronics replace mercury manometers, measuring pressure in real
time.  Generally via Swan-Ganz catheter entering right atrium.

Monitor is connected to a catheter covered with heparinized saline (to
prevent clotting), which has lumen(s) to measure pressure, O2, etc.
Balloon on tip of catheter has a channel connected to a 1 ml syringe,
which can inflate or deflate it.  Inflated balloon will float like a
little boat along the direction of blood flow.

Inserted into superior vena cava, or an arm vein, and passed therefrom
to the right atrium. Balloon can be temporarily inflated to float
across tricuspid valve to right ventricle, so RV changes can be
measured.  Or balloon can be inflated again to enter pulmonary
arteries to measure there.  It will lodge in a pulmonary artery,
getting stuck in a "wedge position."  (Lots of other pulmonary
arteries are still working to provide blood flow through lungs.  But
the catheter tip can measure "pulmonary wedge pressure," which predicts
left atrial pressure.  So we can measure 3/4 chambers of the heart as
well as vena cava.  Impossible to get a catheter into left atrium via
any other method.

Left ventricular catheterization is also done, generally via femoral
artery.  This is called an "LV catheter," and is less flexible and
balloon-less, passing against direction of blood flow.  Wires
embedded, attached to a joystick than bends the tip to maneuver around
corners, up around the aortic arch, and finally across aortic valve
into left ventricle.

TRACING HEART RHYTHMS OVER TIME: WIGGERS DIAGRAM traces pressures
through the various parts of the heart over time.  We'll be able to
reproduce this by the end of the cardiac unit.  EKG signals precede
the pressure changes that occur, because electrical signals control
ventricles.

LEFT VENTRICLE: begins with a small increase in pressure resulting
from atrial contraction.  Atrial contraction is responsible for only a
small portion of ventricular filling.  Ventricles depolarize,
beginning to contract, and this increases LV pressure.  When pLV >
pLA, mitral valve closes (the S1 or "lub" sound of the "lubdub"
heartbeat).  Contraction continues, increasing pressure all the way to
110 mm Hg, and then ventricle begins relaxing; pressure drops off.

AORTIC PRESSURE, meanwhile, is gradually falling off during
diastoly, even though it's somewhat high because it hasn't dissipated
from the last beat.  When LV pressure exceeds aorta pressure on the
upswing, the aortic valve opens and volume begins moving to aorta.  S2
or "dub" sound occurs as the aortic valve closes, as LV begins to
relax.

The "A wave" in the LA (and RA, which mirrors it) occurs during
diastoly.  then during systoly, a lot of strain in the LV bulges the
mitral valve a bit back into the atrium, causing the "C wave," a
slight increase of LA pressure which resolves quickly.  Then, during
LV contraction, LA pressure slowly increases because blood is
returning steadily from lungs to LV.  Eventually as the LA pressure
increases passively and the LV pressure decreases in relaxation, the
mitral valve pops back open (making the S3 sound, which we won't care
about for this course).  Most ventricular filling is passive, due to
venous return.  A small bit is due to atrial contraction...

Peak pressure in the right side of the heart mirrors the left side,
but scaled down by 25%.  But volumes are the same, timing is the same.

A split in S2 can be caused by a delay in closure of pulmonic valve.
Normally it closes a bit later than aortic valve --- but we won't
worry about it in this course.

End diastolic volume:	ventricle is full around 120 ml
End systolic volume:	around 50 ml
Ejection fraction:	fraction of end diastolc volume 
			ejected per beat around 50%
