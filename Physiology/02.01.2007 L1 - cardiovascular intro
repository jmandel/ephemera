Dyspnea:              shortness of breath
Angina:               chest pain
Systoli:              peak pressure in arteries, during contraction.
Sinoatrial node:      pacemaker area in right atrial node ("normal")
Atrial fibrillation:  disorganized polarizations -> irregular beat
Stenosis:	      narrowing (of arteries)

CASE HISTORY:
Pt with systolic murmur, heard in 3rd left intercostal space.  EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm, ventricular axis -15deg.  Stress test
showed ST changes "indicative of ischemia."  Referred to NEMC for
cardiac catheterization --> moderate to severe aortic stenosis, severe
blockage of three coronary arteries.  Underwent aortic valve
replacement and coronary bypass surgery.  (MI was deemed imminent.)

Aortic valve replacement with bovine bioprosthetic valve /and/
coronary bypass surgery for 3 arteries.  Two bouts of afib in
hospital, treated with antiarrhythmic drugs.  Released after 10 days
and back to normal activities after 6 weeks.  (But some swelling in
left leg because part of great saphanous vein was used for bypass.)

INTRO HEART ANATOMY 
Vena cava brings blood to heart, blood enters right atrium.
"Tricuspid" valve from RA to RV.  When RV pressure exceeds RA pressure
(when it fills) valve closes.  RV contracts, developing 25/0 mm Hg
pressure.  Blood ejected into pulmonary artery, closing the RV/PA
valve.  Blood flows from PA to lungs, circulates (performing gas
exchange!) and circulates back to pulmonary veins, which carry
oxygenated blood back from lungs.  Arteries and veins are named
anatomically (i.e. for direction) not physiologically (i.e not for
blood oxygenation).

Blood flows from LA to LV across mitral valve (looked like the "mitre"
or bishop's hat).  Mitral valve closes when p(LV) > p(LA).  LV wall is
thicker than RV wall, and will hypertrophy, developing a higher
pressure than RV: 120 mm Hg during systoly (and drops to 0 when
relaxed) --> 120/0 mm Hg.  Blood flows from LV to aorta via aortic
valve, which closes when p(aorta)>p(LV).  

LV is thicker-walled than RV, but smaller cross-sectional area.  Both
pump the same volume of blood per unit time, because they're in a
single pipeline.

IVC/SVC -> RA -> RV -> PA -> Lungs -> PV -> LA -> LV -> aorta -> body

(One branch off the aorta is the broncial, which provides oxygenated
blood to the parenchyma of lungs, which otherwise have no supply.)

INTRO HEART PHYSIOLOGY

Arteries out of heart are all in parallel, so each tissue receives the
same oxygen content.  (Blood doesn't go to one tissue before another.)  

Two substantially separate circulations in series: pulmonary +
systemic.

CARDIAC OUTPUT: total volume of blood flow through systemic (or
		equivalently pulmonary) circulation.

		flow in systemic circ == flow in pulmonary circ.
		CO = Heart rate * Stroke volume, in ml/minute
				  (hard to measure!)

Flow (Q) 	= 	volume / time		ml/min
Velocity (V)	= 	distance / time		cm/min
Velocity (V)	= 	flow / area		cm/min

Velocity slows tremendously as blood flows from aorta (3 cm^2) to
arteries to arterioles (>40000 cm^2) to capillaries.  On venous
return, flow speeds until venae cavae (10 cm^2).

MEASURING CARDIAC OUTPUT:  	Bulk Flow Q = A * V 
				(yields CO - coronary flow)
				
				Echo transducer placed over ascending
				aorta, shoots ultrasound to aorta and
				measures bounce-back from this moving
				target, and delta(freq) is used to
				calculate particle velocity in
				ascending aorta. (NB: coronary
				ciculation comes off before ascending
				aorta, so the coronary flow is not
				included in this calculation.

Pressure in aorta never settles to zero, beceause some blood is always
left over in the vessel during the short time between upstrokes.  Peak
pressure ~120 mm, low diastolic pressure around 80 mm.  Secondary peak
after systolic peak is typical.  During systoly, blood injected into
aorta (elastic) which stretches to absorb some of the energy during
systoly.  So as pressure is falling off, the aortic wall recoils to
cause a "dichrotic notch," or small increase in pressure.

Mean pressure falls ~1/3 of the way up from diastolic to systolic.
MEAN ARTERIAL      P ~= [p(SYS)-p(DIAS)]/3 + p(DIAS)

Flow is driven by differences in pressure.  
Flow from A->B if p(A) > p(B)

deltaV = IR  <--> deltaP = QR,	P = mean pressure
				Q = flow
				R = resistance


Poiseulle's Law:	Q = deptaP * r^4 / 8HL
		 	deltaP = Q * 8HL / r^4,	Q = flow
						P = pressure
						H = viscosity
						L = vessel length
			So, a small change in length of blood vessel
			causes a big change in flow (x2 -> x16)
