Throax:  Anatomy of Mediastinum
02.01.2007

HEART is inside the central throacic core, with necks extending up
towards head, and inferior border are the domes of
diaphragm. MEDIASTINUM has anterior, superior, middle, posterior
components.

Heart exists within the middle, surrounded by a fibrous, collagenous
inelastic CT sac or "PERICARDIUM."  

PHRENIC NERVE innervates diaphragm, originating "C345 keeps the
diaphram alive," descending through mediastinum along fibrous
pericardium to insert on hemithorax (one on R/L).  We'll incise the
pericardium anterior to the PN after lifting these nerves out of the
way.

INTERNAL THORACIC artery and veins run parasternally. The ITV is often
used instead of saphanous veins for coronary artery bypass.

Heart rotates during development, twisting to make the RV the
anteriormost structure, direcly behind body of sternum.  RA sits off
to the right parasternal region.  LV is inferior and to the left,
resting on surface of diaphragm, and LA is the posteriormost chamber.
So RV IS MOST COMMONLY INJURED by blunt trauma to chest.

PARIETAL PERICARDIAL SURFACE is on the CT wall surrounding the pump.
Visceral tissue surrounds the organ proper.  Serous slippery
secretions surround pump to reduce friction.  (Prevent friction,
pericarditis.)

INTERNAL JUGULAR + SUBCLAVIAN venous system forms the BRACHIOCEPHALIC
venous system (one on L/R).  These two brachiocephalic veins come
together, forming the SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The SVC on the far right and
the ASCENDING AORTA on its left.

Tributary to superior vena cava brings blood from extremities, head,
and neck: the rightward great vessel

TRANSVERSE SINUS is a potential space between great vessles.  We can
separate great vessels from the heart, leavnig only the veins draining
back into atrium.  OBLIQUE PERICARDIAL SINUS rests below these great
vessels.  The INFERIOR VENA CAVA brings blood from points south; we'll
cut it out too.  The pump is thus separated from its vessels, and can
be removed from the body and studied.  We'll focus on this now.

Insert probe into RA, leaving a pump on a hinge so we can see anterior
(RV, RA) and posterior surface (LV, LA).  Once oriented, incise
through RA wall parallel to probe, extending from SVC to IVC.  Create
a flap to open RA at 90deg angle towards RV, and see that the muscular
surface is quite thing.  PECTINATE MUSCLAR SYSTEM is a matrix of
myocardial tissue in the wall of the atrium that contract sequentially
and circumferentially.  Inside the surface is smooth and muscular,
with an oval-shaped (likely closed) divet known as the FOSSA OVALIS.
Embriologically this brought O2 from maternal placenta into fetus.
Below this, the EUSTACIAN VALVE remains from what used to be an IVC
valve.

Large CAPACITANT VEINS ARE CALLED SINUSES, and are present in coronary
system and cranium.  CORONARY SINUS brings blood out to get
re-oxygenated.  Notice the right atrio/ventrical TRICUSPID VALVE.

Running between atria and ventricles, and between ventricles, are
SULCI, deviations in the surface of the pump.  There are
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SULCI and INTERVENTRICULAR SULCI between R/L
ventricles.  (If arteries were sticking /out/ above heart surface,
they'd take a squashing as heart pumped --- these grooves keep the
coronaries flush agains the surface.)  CORONARY ARTERIES run along
sulci, coming off of ASCENDING AORTA.

The ASCENDING AORTA is the only portion of the aorta that lives in the
middle mediastinum, and it provides ONLY the coronary arteries.

LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY (LAD) and the LEFT CIRCUMFLEX
ARTERY. So, 
		Left  Coronary --> LAD + Left CIRC
		Right Coronary --> Marginal + RPD

Two major points: coronary arteries are valveless, so blood flows
according to delta(P).  Collaterals will form between coronary system.
MUST understand thse four arteries and their anastamoses.
		
	Right Coronary Artery <--> Left Circumflex Coronary Artery
	LAD                   <--> Right Posterior Descending

MODERATOR BAND contains lots of conductive tissue (EXAM*).  Heart
proper comprises epicardial (outer), myocardium (muscular),
endocardium (contiguous with vascular endothelium).  The sinoatrial
node RA cells send electrical signals (P wave in EKG) down conduction
fibers within the endocardial surface, thence cell-to-cell.
Conduction extends from endocardial surface through myocardium to
epicardial surface.  Conduction stimulates anterior papillary very
early on, before the myocardium.  Papillary muscles must also receive
stimulation to contract before the rest of the myocardium to avoid
letting ventrical blood regurgitate back into the atrium.  So the A/V
valves must be closed during systoly (not regurgitate or PROLAPSE).
Tricuspid valve has cord-like tendonae connecting them to papillary
muscles, which contract to haul down on the tendos and hold the valve
leaflets in place.  So this happens early on in systoly, 

They don't contract to pull leaflets open; they contract to keep the
valve closed during ventricular sytoly.

The only valve in the arterial system is between the LV and the
asending aorta.  
              -
             /A\
            /L R\        Pulmonary artery
	   -------
            \L R/        Aortic artery
             \P/      
              - 

During systoly Ventricle's presure is greater than aorta, so blood
flows.  Arteries stretch, gaining potential energy; when ventricle is
through contracting, the pressure starts to fall, and potential energy
becomes kinetic, squeezing down on blood to produce diastolic
pressure.  Some volume goes retrograde toward ventricle, but the valve
closes.  

Coronary arteries are closed during systoly, because the valves are
closed.  Open only during diastoly!  So one of the most important
therapies for MI is RATE CONTROL, making diastoly last longer than
systoly to allow flow down coronaries and avoid ischemia.  

The body's Achilles' Heel: Coronary arteries are EPICARDIAL!  On the
EPICARDIAL surface, whilst conduction is ENDOCARDIAL.  The coronary
artery has to send a piercing vessel all the way down to endocardial
surface, and it needs to carry O2 through myocardium all the way out
--- these myocardial cells steal O2 on its journey to endocardium.
Therefore the conduction system is END-ARTERIAL... THE LAST SUPPPLIED,
THE FIRST TO DIE.

A PATIENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE DISCOMFORT TO BE AT RISK FOR MI. We're
worried about heart rhythms, skipped beats, etc.

CO = HR * SV.  Supply and Demand: if stenosis prevents O2 to myo and
endocardium, muscle will start to get acidic, dysfunction and pain.
But viscera is not innervated by point-specific sensory nerves.  We
interpret visceral sensation vaguely.  (Parietal and somatic sensation
are point-specific.)  So potential distribution of chest discomfort
can present all the way up to lower jaw pain and tooth-ache!

So a pt with pain no matter the exertion is unstable.  Stable angina
only occurs when CO is high.
