Childhood Social Development: Risk and Resiliency
02.01.2007

TEMPERAMENT: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WITH SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES, part of
what defines who we are, possibly with genetic basis.  The "how" of
our basic style.  Outgoing, shyness, aggressiveness --- have two kinds
of consequences:	1) Individual's response to the world, and
			2) World's response to individual

			Temperment affects pleasantness to be around;
			general consensus emerges about some people.
			"There is no single optimal temperament," but 
			rather we think about GOODNESS OF FIT within
			one's situation (family, school, etc.)

We talk about "mothers," but what really matters is PRIMARY CAREGIVES.
Could be father, grandparent, etc, that makes the differences.

9 Dimensions of temperament show a wide variability:  
   activity level,
   rhythmicity/regularity (eat/sleep/bowel external w/o schedule),
   distractability (when on a task, how easily are you distracted),
   approach/withdrawal (desire to be around new people),
   adaptability,
   attention span (in absence of distraction, how long can you focus),
   intensity (how strong are your reactions to things),
   threshold (how much stimulus does it take to get a reaction),
   mood

EASY TEMPERAMENT: 40% of infants, develop regular schedules naturally.
Positive mood and approah to new situations.  Middle-of-the-road on
other dimensions.

DIFFICULT TEMPERAMENT: 10% of infants.  Irregular, difficulty with new
situations, negative baseline mood, and intense reactions.

SLOW TO WARM UP: 15% of infants.  Low activity, mild reactions,
negative mood, slow adjustment to change.  Looks pretty good in
familiar settings.	

Ask: how do they respond to new foods, how do they like the bath
water, do they resist getting dressed?

Another consideration: what kind of caregiver fits best for a
particular child.  E.g. easy child with easy parent works pretty well.
But a difficult parent with a slow-to-warm-up child is likely to be
cause friction.

HEALTH AND TEMPERAMENT:  
	High reactivity involves high cortisols, allergies, CHD.
	High activity/distractibility correlates with ADHD
	Changes from baseline mood/activity: thyroid? depression?
	High threshold -> sensation seeking, addiction, law-breaking
